https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31958370/why-php-function-strwordcount-returns-different-count-from-js-equivalent
Question Body:
 <p>I have this JS code which I think is equivalent to the PHP <code>str_word_count()</code> function, but still they return different words counts.</p>

<p>My JS code:</p>

<pre><code>//element f9 value  is:
"Yes, for all people asking ? ? ? their selfs Have you ever dreamed to 
visite World Travel Market 2015 ? we can confirm that now it is a great

words = words.replace(/[ ]{2,}/gi," ");
words = words.replace(/\n /,"\n");
words = words.split(' ').length;

Question Body:
 <p>My .NET 4 application uses the WPF TreeView which I have enhanced to enable keyboard navigation and lazy loading, for example. My <strong>problem</strong> is that, very rarely, the exception shown below is thrown. This happened to me only once during months of development, and I have bug reports from several customers who also get this once in a while. It is so rare that I cannot change something, play around with the app for a while and know if the problem is gone or not.</p>

<p>But my main <strong>question</strong> is: the stack trace shows only Microsoft code, there is nothing from me in there. Is this a bug in .NET/WPF? And are there any chances of getting to the root cause?</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1269696/how-do-i-do-this-in-entity-framework-multiple-wheres-or-join
Question Body:
 <p>I have 2 tables that have a relation ship to each other</p>

<p>Table A has 1 to many relationship with table B, so this creates a navigation property into each.</p>

<p>Now I need to check a value from Table A (userName) and I need to check a value from table B (ClubId).</p>

<p>So in my mind it would be something like</p>

<pre><code>Join the tables together
Where A.userName == "bob" &amp;&amp;
where B.clubId == "Car"

// return the count.
</code></pre>

<p>but now I know with Entity stuff it should make joins less common so I am wondering if I can do it with a join then.</p>

<p>I tried this</p>

<pre><code>int count = Entity.TableA.where(a =&gt; a.userName == "bob" &amp;&amp; a.TableB.where(i =&gt; i.ClubId == "Car")).Count();
</code></pre>

<p>so this does not work since it won't return the right type(the 2nd where). This is just how I thought along the lines how I would expect it to be done would work.</p>

<p>So how should it look?</p>

<p>P.S </p>

<p>I rather have an example done in the Linq method queries like I did above.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7447836/perfile-cppflags-in-androidmk
Question Body:
 <p>I'm working on an Android.mk file in which, for a single module, one of the files needs different CPPFLAGS; namely, it needs -frtti enabled, while others need the Android default of -fno-rtti.</p>

<p>The obvious solution was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1305665/253526">target-specific variables</a>, but oddly they do not seem to affect compilation, even with some fiddling to ensure the values should be fixed at the right time.</p>

<p>Here's an extract from my Android.mk (names changed to protect me):</p>

<pre><code>LOCAL_MODULE := foo_bar

LOCAL_SRC_FILES := \
    foo_bar.cpp \
    foo_baz.cpp

my_intermediates:= $(local-intermediates-dir)/foo_baz.o
$(my_intermediates): LOCAL_CPPFLAGS := -frtti
</code></pre>

<p>I have tried simply doing <code>foo_baz.o:</code> in lieu of $(my_intermediates), and have tried substituting <code>+=</code> for <code>:=</code> to no change.</p>

<p>So, is there an Android-specific way to override CPPFLAGS (or CFLAGS) for a specific source file?</p>

<p>(In this case I'm using the Eclair Android sources, though it may apply to the NDK; see my answer, below.)</p>

<p>I mean here some algorithmic/programming approach. For instance, now I calculate <strong>hash code from image's byte array</strong> and compare these hash code values. That is work great but fail in case of different resolutions, i.e. images are identical <strong>by eye</strong> but different in it byte content. </p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26739125/grails-command-objects-what-is-the-motivation-behind-them
Question Body:
 <p>While reading "The Definitive Guide To Grails", I am a little confused as to <strong>Command Objects</strong>. They seem to be a wrapper around domain classes to assist with validation but that is functionality already available in domain classes via built in constraints and further via custom validators so then what does a command object do really and what motivates us to need it? </p>

<p>The book starts the discussion on command objects by stating that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Sometimes a particular action doesn’t require the involvement of a
  domain class but still requires the validation of user input."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, then it demonstrates the declaration of and the usage of a command object with regards to an <code>Album</code> domain class. So, it seems whatever a command object does is still closely related to domain classes. I'm sure my confusion is completely a result of my lack of understanding and so I wish to seek any clarification. Thanks.</p>

Question Body:
 <p>I have a very simple question that I would like to ask those who has a much better knowledge than I do.</p>

<p>The basis of the question is. When developing a mobile website. Should I dynamically resize the images that I get from external sources to be smaller. Or should I leave them as big images and handle it with css?</p>

<p>The Mobile website I am building pulls a lot of images from a webservice as base 64. Now my train of thought is this. I want to keep the size of my website as small as possible, thus resizing the images to be smaller seems to be a good idea.</p>

<p>On the other hand. Resizing the images with javascript, (lead developer wants everything done client side only...), might cause overhead for the user's mobile device. </p>

<p>What are your opinions on this matter. Should I resize the images or not ?</p>

Question Body:
 <p>If I define a function (maybe a class member function but not inlined) in a header file that is included by two different translation units I get a link error since that function is multiply defined. Not so with templates since they are not compilable types until the compiler resolves a declaration of an object of a templatized type. This made me realize I don't know where compiled template code resides and how it is linked since C++ does not just create multiple copies of code to define SomeTemplateClass. Any info would be appreciated.

    from datetime import datetime

    date = '20120814174530'
    date_to_strp = time.strptime(date, '%Y%m%d%H%M%S') #convert the value of date into strptime
    date_final = datetime.fromtimestamp(mktime(date_to_strp))
    #convert date_to_strp so so i can use it to subtract a value from a timedelta later

    date_substracted = date_final - datetime.timedelta(hours = 36)
</code></pre>

<p>this has an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'timedelta'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>even though I <code>import datetime</code>, I think it was overriden by <code>from datetime import datetime</code>, but when I changed the position of <code>mport datetime</code> and <code>from datetime import datetime</code>, the error is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'module' object has no attribute 'fromtimestamp'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can fix this both error with this code:</p>

<pre><code>    import time
    from time import mktime
    from datetime import datetime

    date = '20120814174530'
    date_to_strp = time.strptime(date, '%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
    date_final = datetime.fromtimestamp(mktime(date_to_strp))

    import datetime

    date_substracted = date_final - datetime.timedelta(hours = 36)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, with this code it is functioning properly, but what I want is that all import part would be at the top as a good practice, any suggestion on how will i do that without any error with this situation or any suggestion on how will i code it in other way around.</p>

  <p>Each new version of the .NET Framework retains features from the previous versions and adds new features. The CLR is identified by its own version number. Some versions of the .NET Framework include a new version of the CLR, but others use an earlier version. For example, the .NET Framework 4 includes CLR 4, but the .NET Framework 3.5 includes CLR 2.0. (There was no version 3 of the CLR.) <strong>Although the .NET Framework 4.5 RC is an in-place update of the .NET Framework 4, the underlying CLR version number is 4.5.</strong>

<p>The documentation goes on to say you can only install .NET Framework 4, .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 on Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Home Edition (i.e no 4.5 mentioned).</p>

<p>I've read in other places that .NET 4.5 can be installed on Win XP. So is this documentation just referring to 4.5RC (not the final 4.5 framework).</p>

<p>My issue is, are we not able to deploy apps built on 4.5 in XP machines. Will Microsoft release a service pack? (unlikely since they don't support XP)</p>

 <p>I want to do a RecursiveDirectoryIterator on a set of folders in a directory, say <code>./temp</code> and then list the files in each folder according to the name of the folder. </p>

<p>For example I have the folders <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. </p>

<p>In A, I have a list of files say, <code>1.txt</code>, <code>2.php</code>, <code>2.pdf</code>, <code>3.doc</code>, <code>3.pdf</code>.</p>

<p>In B, I have <code>1.pdf</code>, <code>1.jpg</code>, <code>2.png</code>.</p>

<p>I want my results to be like this:</p>

<pre><code>A =&gt; List of files in A
B =&gt; List of files in B
</code></pre>

<p>How can this be done?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php 
$scan_it = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator("./temp"); 
foreach(new RecursiveIteratorIterator($scan_it) as $file =&gt;$key) { 
    $filetypes = array("pdf"); 
    $filetype = pathinfo($file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION); 
    if (in_array(strtolower($filetype), $filetypes)) { 
        $dlist=basename($file); //sort 
?&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;?php echo substr(dirname($file),11);?&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;a href="&lt;?php echo $file;?&gt;"&gt;&lt;?php echo basename($file);?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1954443/ipv-multicast-addresses-is-the-group-id-field-effectively-bits-or-bits
Question Body:
 <p>I'm trying to understand the rules for choosing an IPv6 multicast address Group ID, and the RFC seems somewhat inconsistent.  For example, in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2373#section-2.7" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2373</a> section 2.7 this diagram is shown:</p>

<pre><code>|   8    |  4 |  4 |                  112 bits                   |
+------ -+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
|11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |
+--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>... but then in section 2.7.2 it shows this:</p>

<pre><code>|   8    |  4 |  4 |          80 bits          |     32 bits     |
+------ -+----+----+---------------------------+-----------------+
|11111111|flgs|scop|   reserved must be zero   |    group ID     |
+--------+----+----+---------------------------+-----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, are the upper 80 bits of the Group ID field usable or not?  If they are usable, is it only under certain circumstances (e.g. when using non-Ethernet networking technology?)  What problems should I expect to experience if I set these bits when multicasting over an Ethernet LAN?</p>

Question Body:
 <p>How will I fix this problem on Python. Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>    import time
    import datetime
    from time import mktime
    from datetime import datetime

    date = '20120814174530'
    date_to_strp = time.strptime(date, '%Y%m%d%H%M%S') #convert the value of date into strptime
    date_final = datetime.fromtimestamp(mktime(date_to_strp))
    #convert date_to_strp so so i can use it to subtract a value from a timedelta later

    date_substracted = date_final - datetime.timedelta(hours = 36)
</code></pre>

<p>this has an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'timedelta'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>even though I <code>import datetime</code>, I think it was overriden by <code>from datetime import datetime</code>, but when I changed the position of <code>mport datetime</code> and <code>from datetime import datetime</code>, the error is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'module' object has no attribute 'fromtimestamp'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can fix this both error with this code:</p>

<pre><code>    import time
    from time import mktime
    from datetime import datetime

    date = '20120814174530'
    date_to_strp = time.strptime(date, '%Y%m%d%H%M%S')
    date_final = datetime.fromtimestamp(mktime(date_to_strp))

    import datetime

    date_substracted = date_final - datetime.timedelta(hours = 36)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, with this code it is functioning properly, but what I want is that all import part would be at the top as a good practice, any suggestion on how will i do that without any error with this situation or any suggestion on how will i code it in other way around.</p>

<pre><code>if((action.getSource() == btnSave) ||(action.getSource() == btnSavePrint) )
        {
            String findItemNoCommand = "SELECT itemNo FROM `item` WHERE itemName = '" + itemList.getSelectedItem() + "'";

            try

            }

            System.out.println(itemNo);
        }

<p>The code above was written for a <code>ButtonHandler</code></p>

<p>Right now, for the <code>println</code> I'm getting a "<code>com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4ResultSet@1e72cae</code>" .. I don't understand how it is so.. but I'm assuming that ResultSet is the wrong choice here. </p>

<p>My question is.. what can i use there that can work?</p>

<pre><code>--Get Number of Divisors of n

triaList =  [foldr (+) 0 [1..n] | n &lt;- [1..]]

--The same recursive
triaList2 = go 0 1
  where go cs n = (cs+n):go (cs+n) (n+1)

--Finds the first triangular Value with more than n Divisors
sol :: Integer -&gt; Integer
sol n = head $ filter (\x -&gt; numDivs(x)&gt;n) triaList2

<p>This Solution for n=500 (sol 500) is extremly slow (running for more than 2 hours now), so I wondered how to find out why this solution is so slow. Are there any commands that tell me where most of the computation-time is spend so I know which part of my haskell-program is slow? Something like a simple profiler.</p>

<p>To make it clear, i'm not asking <strong>for</strong> a faster solution but for <strong>a way</strong> to find this solution. How would you start if you would have no haskell knowledge?</p>

<p>I tried to write two triaList functions but found no way to test which one is faster, so thats where my problems start.</p>

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34549044/why-are-detected-cli-options-different-when-using-defaultparser-instead-of-gnuparser
Question Body:
 <p>I'm about to migrate some legacy code to contain less deprecated warnings from <em>3rd</em>-party libraries. For Apache <code>commons-cli</code> library (version: <strong>1.3.1</strong>) I detected in the <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/apidocs/org/apache/commons/cli/GnuParser.html" rel="nofollow">official JavaDoc</a> that <code>GnuParser</code> is deprecated and <code>DefaultParser</code> should be used instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@deprecated since 1.3, use the <code>{@link DefaultParser}</code> instead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the following code snippet stops working as expected:</p>

<pre><code>Options options = new Options();    
Option optionGSTypes = new Option(
        "gst","gs-types", true,
        "the supported types, comma-separated: article, category, template, all");
optionGSTypes.setArgs(3);
optionGSTypes.setValueSeparator(',');
options.addOption(optionGSTypes);

// ... other options

// parsed option values are correct, yet this is deprecated
CommandLineParser parser = new GnuParser(); 
CommandLine commands = parser.parse(options, args);

// ... interpret parsed 'commands' and related actual values via CLI
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>setValueSeparator(',')</code> is used here to define a custom separator char <code>,</code> to enable the CLI to support sevaral <em>gst</em>-types (see code snippet).</p>

<p>As input the following program arguments are used to call the CLI: </p>

<p><code>java -jar MyCLI.jar -gst category -gsd 4</code></p>

<p>Obviously, several other arguments might also have been added after the gsd parameter. The expected and <em>correctly</em> parsed options  for the separator-less use of the "gst" argument are (via <code>GnuParser</code>): </p>

<ol>
<li>"category" (and nothing else)</li>
</ol>

<p>However, when I change my code and switch towards the recommended parser via:</p>

<pre><code>CommandLineParser parser = new DefaultParser();
</code></pre>

<p>the resulting, parsed values are detected <em>incorrectly</em> as:</p>

<ol>
<li>"category"</li>
<li>"-gsd"</li>
<li>"4"</li>

<p>Hint: I used a debugger to verify the incorrect result of the parse process via inspecting the field <code>values</code> in <code>org.apache.commons.cli.Option</code> via the returned <code>commands</code> variable.</p>

<p>My expectation would be that the internal change of the parser should <strong>not</strong> yield different results, as this breaks existing code. Has anyone ever encountered the same behavior with Apache Commons-CLI when switching to <code>DefaultParser</code> and several option values and custom separators?</p>

<p>Is there a difference in the construction/usage of <code>DefaultParser</code> that I might have overseen?</p>

Question Body:
 <p>I'm thinking of adding a reputation system to my Django web application; the site is already being used so I'm trying to be careful about my choices.</p>

<p>Reputation is generated in all actions that contribute to the site, similar to Stackoverflow's system.</p>

<p>I know there are literally millions of ways of implementing this, and this is why I feel quite lost.</p>

<p>Two alternatives I am not sure about are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep track of reasons why reputation was incremented</li>
<li>Ignore reasons in order to reduce complexity of the site and overhead</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Would be happy with a few pointers, and directions. Would be very much appreciated!</p>

Question Body:
 <p>I've been running into some issues recently while trying to use Spark on an AWS EMR cluster.</p>

<p>I am creating the cluster using something like : </p>

<pre><code>./elastic-mapreduce --create --alive \
--name "ll_Spark_Cluster" \
--bootstrap-action s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/spark/1.0.0/install-spark-shark.rb \
--bootstrap-name "Spark/Shark" \
--instance-type m1.xlarge \
--instance-count 2 \
--ami-version 3.0.4
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that whenever I try to get data from S3 I get an exception.
So if I start the spark-shell and try something like :</p>

<pre><code>val data = sc.textFile("s3n://your_s3_data")
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following exception :</p>

<pre><code>WARN storage.BlockManager: Putting block broadcast_1 failed
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8001207/compile-time-typeid-without-rtti-with-gcc
Question Body:
 <p>Is there anyway to get compile-time <code>typeid</code> information from GCC with RTTI disabled? Under Visual Studio, a simple command like <code>const char* typeName = typeid(int).name();</code> will appropriately return "int", even if RTTI is disabled. Unfortunately, GCC can't do the same. When I try to call <code>typeid</code> without RTTI, my program crashes. I know disabling RTTI is not part of the standard, but is there anyway I can force GCC to do compile time resolution of known types?</p>

<p>RTTI is disabled for performance reasons. I have no need for runtime RTTI.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Here's what I ended up going with:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; const char* TypeName(void);
template&lt;typename T&gt; const char* TypeName(T type) { return TypeName&lt;T&gt;(); }

#define REFLECTION_REGISTER_TYPE(type) \
    template &lt;&gt; const char* TypeName&lt;type&gt;(void) { return #type; } 
</code></pre>

<p>It requires that <code>REFLECTION_REGISTER_TYPE</code> be called for every type that needs reflection info. But as long as it's called for every required type, calling <code>TypeName&lt;int&gt;</code> works perfectly. I also added the function <code>TypeName(T type)</code> which means you can do things like this: <code>int x = 0; printf(TypeName(x));</code> and it will print out "int". GCC should really be able to do this at compile time like VC++ can. </p>
